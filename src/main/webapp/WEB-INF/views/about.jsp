    <h2>About ShareMeals</h2>

    <p>ShareMeals is a community-driven platform dedicated to reducing food waste and fighting hunger. Our goal is to connect individuals, restaurants, and caterers who have surplus food with those who need it.</p>

    <p>We believe in the power of sharing and technology to solve real-world problems. Whether you're a student with leftovers, a volunteer ready to help, or a business wanting to give back — ShareMeals is here for you.</p>

    <h3>Why We Started This Journey</h3>
    <p>Our food recovery journey began with a simple realization: while many catered events discard perfectly good prepared food at the end of the night, countless families in Scarborough face food insecurity. Witnessing this contrast firsthand, we felt a deep sense of responsibility to bridge this gap. We saw an opportunity to reduce food waste while making a positive impact on our community.</p>

    <h3>Our Community Focus</h3>
    <p>Scarborough holds a special place in our hearts. It's a vibrant and diverse neighborhood, but many families here struggle with access to nutritious meals. Through conversations with community leaders and local organizations, we realized there was an urgent need to support those who are most vulnerable. Our program is not just about distributing food — it’s about strengthening the community by ensuring that no prepared meal goes to waste.</p>

    <h3>Our Core Values</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Food Safety:</strong> We follow strict protocols to ensure that all recovered food is safe and high-quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Dignity and Respect:</strong> We prioritize maintaining the dignity of our recipients by offering them a choice and ensuring anonymity.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Collaboration:</strong> We believe in working hand-in-hand with community centers and leaders to identify those in need and provide a seamless distribution process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Our Commitment to Positive Change</h3>
    <p>This is not just a project — it's a mission to create a more sustainable, compassionate, and connected community in Scarborough. As we grow, we remain committed to preserving the values that drive our passion for helping others.</p>
